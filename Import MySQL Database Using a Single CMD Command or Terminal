Import MySQL Database Using a Single CMD Command

Syntax

mysql -u USERNAME -p DATABASE_NAME < PATH_TO_SQL_FILE

Example (Windows / Laragon / XAMPP)

If you want to import blog.sql into student database:

mysql -u root -p student < D:\backup\blog.sql

Another Example

mysql -u root -p blogs < D:/Website-Backup/blog-db/blogs.sql

Press Enter, then type your MySQL password → import will start.

How to know it's completed?

If the CMD prompt returns normally

Example

C:\> mysql -u root -p student < D:\backup\blog.sql
C:\>

No error message = Import finished successfully.

If the import was still running, the cursor would keep blinking and CMD would be busy.
